    summary: >
      Being a global pandemic, the COVID-19 outbreak received global media attention. 
      In this study, we analyze news publications from CNN and The Guardian - two of the world's most influential media organizations. 
      The dataset includes more than 36,000 articles, analyzed using the clinical and biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP) models from the Spark NLP for Healthcare library, which enables a deeper analysis of medical concepts than previously achieved. 
      The analysis covers key entities and phrases, observed biases, and change over time in news coverage by correlating mined medical symptoms, procedures, drugs, and guidance with commonly mentioned demographic and occupational groups. 
      Another analysis is of extracted Adverse Drug Events about drug and vaccine manufacturers, which when reported by major news outlets has an impact on vaccine hesitancy.

- title: Simulating prevention operations at sea against maritime piracy

    summary: >
      Maritime piracy has been a major issue for the international community in the last decade and affected the global economy. 
      As a reaction to this issue, international organizations have deployed naval forces to protect maritime transportation in the affected regions. 
      In this study, we present a simulation-based analysis tool to evaluate the effectiveness of operations to prevent piracy. 
      In our model, we consider three stakeholders' views (pirates, maritime transporters, and naval forces) and modelled their behaviours separately, using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) approaches. 
      Our hybrid DES and ABS model is used to simulate hypothetical scenarios on the Gulf of Aden for understanding the cause and effect relationship between naval resource allocation and piracy prevention. 
      Our experimental results showed that, first, helicopters are most valuable in prevention and, second, either patrolling or escorting naval ships must carry a helicopter for effective prevention.

- title: Simulation Modeling of Maritime Piracy using Discrete Event and Agent-Based Approaches

  paper:
    summary: >
      In the last decade, maritime piracy has affected the global economy that forced the countries to react. Most
      of the reaction is regarding force deployment in the affected regions. In this study, we present a simulation
      based analysis tool that aims at understanding the relationship between naval forces deployment and
      preventing piracy. We consider three stakeholders' views; pirates, maritime transportation, and naval forces.
      We initially created a classical Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model and adopted event scheduling
      approach. However, later, we discovered that since the behaviours of entities, interaction between entities,
      and the autonomy properties of entities are significant, Agent Based Simulation (ABS) concepts are
      appropriate for modeling. Finally, we ended up with a hybrid DES and ABS model. Our conceptual model
      is created using event graphs and the model is implemented using SharpSim DES library. Additionally, we
      coupled an open source Geographic Information System (GIS), GreatMap, with SharpSim.
